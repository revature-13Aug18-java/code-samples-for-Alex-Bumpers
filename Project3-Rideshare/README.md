# Project 3 - Revature Rideforce: Ridesharing Application
Rideforce is a ride sharing application that allows users to find rides to work using the Google Maps API.

I was one of three team leads for this project, and in my role, I managed the **DevOps** team.

My duties for the Rideforce project included:
- Managing a DevOps team and delegating tasks to these team members.
- Implementing, creating, and managing a collection of Docker containers which allowed us to separate and isolate all of our various microservices.
- Implementing a Jenkins pipeline for the continuous deployment of our microservices.
- Managing RDS, EC2, and S3 instances using Amazon Web Services.
- Creating a separate development environment in order to isolate development from production. This environment also included a continuous deployment pipeline.
- Automating testing with the use of quality gates in order to ensure that code with failing tests or other similar issues would not be deployed to production.
- Automating code quality and test coverage management through the use of SonarCloud/SonarQube and Jacoco, respectively.
- Generating documentation using Javadocs and Compodoc, and automated the hosting of this documentation via Amazon S3.

Technologies I've used for this project included: **Jenkins**, **Amazon Web Services**, **EC2**, **S3**, **RDS**, **Trello**, **Git**, **Github**, **Jacoco**, **Docker**, **Docker**, **SonarCloud/SonarQube**.

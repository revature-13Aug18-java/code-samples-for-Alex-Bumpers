# Project 2 - Music Based Social Network (MBSN): Full-Stack Spring with Angular and a CI/CD Pipeline

Java/Back end: https://github.com/alexbumpers/project2-java-ANM
Angular/Front-end: https://github.com/alexbumpers/project2-angular-ANM

MBSN is a social network that uses the Spotify Web API to connect users based on common interests in music. Users can create an account, log in, log out, edit their profiles, search for songs and add them to their profile, view their profile page, view a timeline of other users' activity, and see common musical interests.

My primary roles in this project involved working extensively with both our client-side application and DevOps.

For **DevOps**, I handled the creation and maintenance of continuous integration and deployment of our client-side and server-side applications through the use of Codeship and Jenkins respectively, in conjunction with Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2, RDS, and more). Through the use of Jenkins and Codeship pipelines, I was able to automatically deploy our application on successful git merges to the master branch.

For the **client-side/front-end** of the application, I styled most pages of the applications using CSS, and handled tasks such as API/HTTP calls throughout the application using a combination of HTML, Angular, and TypeScript. I also developed much of the structure of the application and wrote the logic for various databinding and DOM manipulation tasks.

Although I was less involved with **server-side** technologies for this project than with DevOps and front-end, I did assist building and customizing certain functionality for the Spring controllers.

Technologies used include: **Java**, **Spring**, **Angular**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Jenkins**, **Codeship**, **Amazon Web Services**, **EC2**, **S3**, **RDS**.

### Project 0 - Java CLI Banking Application
This application allows users to create a bank account and interact with that account through the command line. Users are able to deposit, withdraw, and check funds in their account. The application includes validation for usernames, emails, and more. Users are able to log in to and out of their accounts, maintaining session state via file IO and the singleton design pattern.

### Project 1 - Full-Stack Java Employee Reimbursement Application
This project is a web-based CRUD application for requesting, viewing, approving, and denying financial reimbursements between managers and employees. 

### Project 2 - Music Based Social Network (MBSN): Full-Stack Spring with Angular and a CI/CD Pipeline
MBSN is a social network that uses the Spotify Web API to connect users based on common interests in music. Users can create an account, log in, log out, edit their profiles, search for songs and add them to their profile, view their profile page, view a timeline of other users' activity, and see common musical interests.

My primary roles in this project involved working extensively with both our client-side application and DevOps, implementing principles such as continuous deployment.

### Project 3 - Revature Rideforce: Ridesharing Application
Rideforce is a ride sharing application that allows users to find rides to work using the Google Maps API. It is built using Spring and Angular, and uses a microservice-based architecture.

I was one of three team leads for this project, and in my role, I managed the **DevOps** team.
